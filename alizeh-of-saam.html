  <h2>Notable Quotes from the Book(s):</h2>
  <p>Sorry for the really long list of quotes. I love them all<3</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"I will say this once, angel, for I feel you should be warned. No man alive has ever loved a woman the way that I love you, and I would rather die, damned as I am, than disgrace us both with the pitiful, unrequited performance of my heart."</li>
    <li>"My life, my heart, my blood—they’re already yours. Heaven knows I have nothing left to give you that isn’t already in pieces."</li>
    <li>"He saw nothing but her. He wanted nothing but her."</li>
    <li>"He was terrified she'd go and do something brutal, like smile at him."</li>
    <li>"'But life cannot be experienced one emotion at a time. It is a tapestry of sensation, a braided rope of feeling. We must allow for reflection even when we suffer. We must reach for compassion even when we triumph. If you spend your days waiting for your sorrows to end so that you might finally live' –he shook his head– 'you will die an impatient man.'"</li>
    <li>"It occurred to him then, with a vague panic, that he'd follow her off a cliff if she were the one to lead him there."</li>
    <li>"He wondered if she had any idea what he'd do for her, the worlds he'd destroy for her."</li>
    <li>"This tremble inside him, this madness in his heart—it was all for her. All for her."</li>
    <li>"His enormous, unbridled smile was a cruel shock to her system, for it shattered the armor he wore, rendering him glorious in the aftermath."</li>
    <li>"It would be simpler for him to lay down and die for her than to try to convey the enormity of all that he felt in her presence."</li>
    <li>"She’d begun to realize that it was pain that had built her; pain that had both softened and scarred her; pain that had prepared her most for this moment."</li>
  </ul>
