  	<h2>Relationships:</h2>
  	<ul>
    	<li>Friend: Ariel (LaLa) Lagrimas, Donatella Dragna, Scarlett Dragna</li>
    	<li>Stepsister (relationship of dramatic irony unfortunately): Marisol Tourmaline</li>
    	<li>Boyfriend: Jacks of the Hollow</li>
  	</ul>
  
  	<h2>Background:</h2>
  	<p>Evangeline, a cheerful and optimistic pink-haired girl, strikes a deal with the Prince of Hearts, Jacks, in order to prevent her step-sister from marrying the "love of her life," Luc. Since her parents died, her step-mother forced her to give up her work at her father's curiosity shop. She lives in the same universe as the Caraval series, eventually falling in love with Jacks (I'm pretty sure that's not a spoiler because if you search up Once Upon a Broken Heart, there's like a 95% chance you'll see something about Jacks.)</p>

  	<h2>Notable Quotes from the Book(s):</h2>
  	<ul>
    	<li>"I believe there are far more possibilities than happily ever after or tragedy. Every story has the potential for infinite endings."</li>
    	<li>"I don't know if I can fix your broken heart, but you can take mine because it's already yours."</li>
    	<li>"And he loved her. He loved her. He loved her. He loved her. He loved her so much he’d rewritten history."</li>
    	<li>"Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love."</li>
    	<li>"Jacks had so badly wanted to tell her that he couldn't even remember what Donatella looked like, that Evangeline's face was the only one he saw whenever he closed his eyes, that he would go with her anywhere...if he could."</li>
  	</ul>
