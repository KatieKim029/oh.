				<h1>Favorite Book Characters</h1>
			</div>
			<p>This is a very, very small website of my favorite book characters from a grand total of TWO genres: romance and fantasy. I made this because I love to read:) (I read 102 books in 2025! Unfortunately, I do not believe I will ever be able to do that again now that I am not in middle school.) My all-time favorite book is Redeeming 6 by Chloe Walsh, and two of the six characters on this website are from that series (Boys of Tommen). Tied for second place are A Curse For True Love by Stephanie Garber, Better Than the Movies by Lynn Painter, and Every Spiral of Fate by Tahereh Mafi.</p>
