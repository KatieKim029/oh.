  <p>Liz and Wes were "enemies" for much of their lives. As children, they lived close to each other and would often prank each other, though Wes only did so as a way to maintain close contact with Liz. As they grew up, they continued to share a rivalry even though Michael, who also lived in their neighborhood and would often help Liz, moved away. However, at the beginning of the novel, it is revealed that Michael (Liz's long-time crush) is moving back. Liz strikes a deal with Wes to get them together, which eventually ends up with Liz and Wes becoming friends and dating.</p>
