  <h2>Notable Quotes from the Book(s):</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>"'I never kid about my warrior demigod status.' <br> 'Oh. My. God.' I lower my voice, having forgotten to whisper. 'You are nothing but a bird with an attitude. Okay, so you have a few muscles, I’ll grant you that. But you know, a bird is nothing but a barely evolved lizard. That’s what you are.'"</li>
    <li>"'How long did you resist?' asks Uriel. 'Did you push her away? Did you tell her she meant no more to you than any other animal? Oh, Raffe, did she die thinking you didn't care about her? How tragic. That must just tear you to pieces.' <br> Raffe looks up with murder in his eyes. 'Don't. Talk. About. Her.'"</li>
    <li>"Lately, I seem to be all about you."</li>
    <li>"I knew from the start that your loyalty would get you killed. I just never thought it would be your loyalty to me that would do it."</li>
    <li>"Power is best held by the ones who don’t want it."</li>
  </ul>
